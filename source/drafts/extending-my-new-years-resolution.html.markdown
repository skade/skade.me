Last year, _the_ new years resolution in my peer group to learn a new programming language, as every year. I considered that for a while and while searching for languages, I decided the reverse: my new years resolution for 2014 was strictly _not_ to learn a new language except if my job dictates (I learned Python because of that)[1]. I consider that a success and will continue in 2015.

My reason was and is as follows: I do know and have used in practice enough languages to implement almost all parts of a current (internet) software stack competently. Language-wise, I am a full-stack engineer (I don't give much for the term). I do list "programming languages" as one my hobbies. However, I'm growing tired of the language craze: while new things like [Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org/) and others have lots of appeal to me, they also mean spending lots of time working with things I'll probably never use. Also, if I ever wanted to learn them for practical usage, I'd have to learn them _deep_. This takes a lot of the metal bandwidth and efforts away from other things I could learn about: the building blocks I build systems with. Operating systems, databases, queues, methodologies, people, all the design stuff.

So, this year again, I'm not going to learn a new programming language, but I'm going to play around with those I know.

[1]: For those that follow me closely: I started learning Rust in 2013, so I don't even break that rule :).
