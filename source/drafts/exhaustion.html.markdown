After trying Ruby for the first time in 2003 and starting to actively participate in the community since 2006, I have been organizationally involved in the Ruby community since February 2008, the month in which I got my moderator badge for [rubyforen.de](http://rubyforen.de). We were talking about the "new" Rails 2.0 then.

Since then, I wrote 4800 posts on the bulletin board, got involved in organizing smaller events, ran 3 conferences, joined the core team of [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com) and worked with the [Ruby Berlin e.V.](http://rubyberlin.org) to improve communication between organizers of community events in Germany. I also spoke on a number of events, from Europe over Japan to Argentina, either on Lightning Talks or on the main track. The Ruby community was always a welcoming place and supported all those exploits with great generosity.

eurucamp 2013 is over and most of the exhaustion should have worn of by now. Sadly, it hasn't. Instead, I have the growing feeling that I lost a bit of focus on myself. There are quite a few personal errands I left unfinished while running up for this years event. Looking at the number of things I have in my head that I wanted to organize this autumn, I've come to the following conclusion: either I take a hard break now or I will end up with a number of unfinished projects I don't have the energy to bring to an end.

This is why I am ending my community involvements effectively now and will not start working on anything new. This mostly means:

* I am retiring as a Padrino core member
* I will, at this time, not be involved in the planning eurucamp 2014, if there should be one
* My tiny planned projects for the Ruby Berlin e.V. will be put on hold
* The eurucamp hackdays are discontinued, unless someone wants to pick them up
* A few pre-planned events will get the axe

I will still run the [elasticsearch UG Berlin](http://www.meetup.com/ElasticSearch-UG-Berlin/), but I am not sure whether I will revive my other UGs as planned. I will also do some final wrapup for eurucamp 2013, most of all overseeing the video postproduction. I will keep my moderator- and commit-bit for most of the things I am in, it doesn't hurt and I have no intention vanishing.

I am sorry if anyone had hopes on my future community work. If you are interested in taking some stuff over, contact me. This is in no means a goodby, I just need to invest some time into myself at the moment.

Still, I will try to work on this blog more and hopefully grow it into something interesting for you.

Maybe the tornado will start moving again.
